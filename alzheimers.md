### General Conclusions

- "The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The three cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine have about the same efficacy for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "Out of the two cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil and rivastigmine, donepezil leads to fewer adverse events when used for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
