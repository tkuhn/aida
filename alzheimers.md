### General Conclusions

- "The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The three cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine have about the same efficacy for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "Out of the two cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil and rivastigmine, donepezil leads to fewer adverse events when used for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."


### Outcomes

- 2. "The treatment of Alzheimer's disease with one of the three cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine improves the patients' score in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE)."
- 3. "The treatment of Alzheimer's disease with one of the three cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine improves the patients' score in the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)."
- 4. "The treatment of Alzheimer's disease with one of the three cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine improves the patients' score in the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS)."

### Individual Studies
