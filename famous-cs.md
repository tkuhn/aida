==========================================================

(work in progress...)

#### Charles Babbage (1791-1871)

- It is possible to build a fully automatic general-purpose computing machine that can be programmed with arbitrary sequences of encoded instructions.

#### John Backus (1924-2007)

- _(with Peter Naur)_ The Backus-Naur Form is a suitable and effective notation for the definition of context-free languages.

#### Alonso Church (1903-1995)

- _(also independently by Alan Turing)_ The problem of determining the provability of arbitrary propositions in first-order logic is undecidable.
- _(with Alan Turing)_ A function on the natural numbers is effectively computable in a general informal sense if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine.

#### Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002)

- The use of GOTO statements in programming is harmful to program structure.

#### Douglas Engelbart (1925-2013)

- Pointing devices as the computer mouse enable very efficient and intuitive interaction with graphical user interfaces.

#### Kurt GÃ¶del (1906-1978)

- No consistent system that defines a certain basic level of arithmetic with a finite or at least decidable set of axioms can prove all true statements that can be written in the language of the system.
- No consistent system that defines a certain basic level of arithmetic with a finite or at least decidable set of axioms can prove that the system itself is consistent.

#### Michael I. Jordan

- _(with David Blei and Andrew Ng)_ Latent Dirichlet Allocation is a powerful and accurate method for topic modeling on collections of discrete data such as text corpora.

#### Robert Kowalski (1941-*)

- The subset of first-order logic called Horn clauses can be given a procedural interpretation that is a suitable basis for general-purpose logic-based programming.

#### Ted Nelson (1937-*)

- Hypertext representations are more flexible, more general, and more natural than classical text structure for computer-supported information systems.

#### John von Neumann (1903-1957)

- Computers are more flexible and more powerful if data and program instructions are both stored side by side in the same memory.

#### John McCarthy (1927-2011)

- Artificial intelligence can be achieved by using formal logic to represent and deduce information.
- Common sense reasoning is a central component of artificial intelligence.

#### Marvin Minsky (1927-*)

- _(with Seymour Papert)_ Single-layer perceptrons cannot learn the XOR relation.

#### Frank Rosenblatt (1928-1971)

- The perceptron architecture allows for powerful and accurate algorithms for supervised classification tasks.

#### Herbert Simon (1916-2001)

- _(with Allen Newell)_ Automated reasoning can be suitably implemented as a search tree with the hypothesis at the root and by applying heuristics to trim branches.

#### Alan Turing (1912-1954)

- There is no general algorithm that can decide for all possible programs and inputs whether the program will terminate or run forever.
- _(with Alonso Church)_ A function on the natural numbers is effectively computable in a general informal sense if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine.
