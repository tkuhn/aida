Jacqueline Birks. Cholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2006, Issue 1. Art. No.: CD005593. DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005593.


### General Conclusions

- "The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The cholinesterase inhibitor galantamine is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine is efficacious for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "The three cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine have about the same efficacy for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
- "Out of the two cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil and rivastigmine, donepezil leads to fewer adverse events when used for treating mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease."
