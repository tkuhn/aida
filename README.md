AIDA Sentences
==============

AIDA is a scheme for English sentences. Such sentences are:

- **Atomic:** a sentence describing one thought that cannot be further broken
  down in a practical way
- **Independent:** a sentence that can stand on its own, without external
  references like "this effect" or "we"
- **Declarative:** a complete sentence ending with a full stop that could in
  theory be either true or false
- **Absolute:** a sentence describing the core of a claim ignoring the
  (un)certainty about its truth and ignoring how it was discovered (no
  "probably" or "evaluation showed that"); typically in present tense

Examples
--------

A simple example of an AIDA sentence is:

> Malaria is transmitted by moquitoes.

This is a more specific and more complex example:

> The degree of hepatic reticuloendothelial function impairment does not differ
> between cirrhotic patients with and without previous history of SBP.
